# ATM Management System
This ATM Management System is a Python program that simulates the operation of an Automated Teller Machine. It provides users with a range of banking functionalities, including account creation, login, deposit, withdrawal, PIN code update, and account statement generation.

**Key Features**

* _**Account Creation:**_ Users can create a new account by supplying their name, deposit amount (with a minimum requirement of 50), and a 4-digit PIN code. The system generates a unique user ID and username for each account.

* _**Login System:**_ Users can securely log in using their username and PIN. The system limits the number of login attempts to enhance security.

* _**Account Management:**_ After successful login, users can perform various actions:

    * View account details, including name, username, status, and balance.

    * Deposit funds into their account, with validation checks.

    * Withdraw funds, accounting for a predefined tax rate and ensuring sufficient balance.

    * Update their PIN code for added security.

    * Generate and view account statements.

**Usage**

* Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the main menu and sub-menu options.

* Create accounts, log in, perform transactions, and manage your account.

**Data Storage**
